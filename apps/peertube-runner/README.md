# PeerTube runner

Runner program to execute jobs (transcoding...) of remote PeerTube instances.

This version of runner designed specifically for High Quality SVT-AV1 transcoding.

You can use this runner in Docker using ilfarpro/peertube-runner-av1-hq image.

Otherwise it is highly recommended to use it with latest version of FFMPEG containing SVT-AV1 â‰¥ v2.3.0, which is minimum required version.

SVT-AV1-PSY is incompatible with this runner yet, because it won't encode with fast-decode=2 parameter.
